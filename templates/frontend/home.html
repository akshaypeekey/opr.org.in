            <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp p-home" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The Organisation for People’s Rights (OPR) is a Non-Profit Trust Organisation established under the provisions of the Article 19. (1) (c) of the Indian Constitution.  The OPR shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy and would uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.  Any Indian Citizen 18 years or older has the right to join the OPR as a member.  The OPR is run using only the membership fee collected from each person who joins as a member of the OPR.  The OPR does not accept any donation from anyone.  Section 25 of the Constitution of the OPR (COPR) prohibits it.</p>
            <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp p-home" data-wow-delay="0.4s">The OPR’s Vision is to help the people and the government to establish true democracy in India, with corruption-free, fair, effective and uniform law for everyone in the nation, so that every citizen will have basic rights to lead a decent life with one’s own effort, without fear or having to bow to anyone.</p>
            <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp p-home" data-wow-delay="0.6s">The OPR’s Mission is to take the ‘Constitution for the People’ (CP) with four hundred and thirty sections of reforms to the citizens of India to find out whether majority of the citizens of India want these four hundred and thirty sections of the CP incorporated in the Constitution of India.</p>
            <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp p-home" data-wow-delay="0.8s">When majority of Indian citizens want to incorporate all of the four hundred and thirty sections of the CP in the Constitution of India, the OPR will help the Government incorporate it as per the provisions in the current Constitution of India.  The OPR believes that these sections of the CP are truly democratic and fair and which, when incorporated in the Constitution of India, will achieve OPR’s Vision.</p>
