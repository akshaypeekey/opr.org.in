            <p class="text-justify-left wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">India obtained freedom 72 years ago.  We obviously have progressed a lot too.  Although, 72 years ago, we did not even have enough food for all Indians, today, in India, we have enough resources for all Indians not only just to eat, but also to live in prosperity.  In spite of this, a significant number of Indians continue to live in poverty!  Why is it so?  It is because those who were in power, long, long ago, made most people poor for easier control like slaves.  To achieve their vested interests, they were not giving people’s due shares using biased rules.  They retained their vested interests, using the “divide and rule” policy, manipulating the poor to keep them fighting among themselves in the name of God, Religion, Caste, State, Language, Political affinity, Position, Class, Grade etc.  This infighting shifted away the focus of the poor from working to succeed in life.  Those in power now don’t know how to change it.  Therefore the slave mentality and sub-ordinate mentality of the people have not yet changed!</p>
            <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">People, we need to stop this.  There is a way to change this sad state of affairs, and for all Indians to get fair and rightful shares and build a decent life.  Let us make fair rules by ourselves, for us.  In a democracy, when we have majority, we have the right and power to do that.  There are provisions existing in our Constitution to make amendments for the benefit of the people.  The OPR has proposed a set of reforms to the existing Constitution, under the name of the ‘Constitution for the People’ (CP) with 430 sections, providing tangible minimum guarantee for all citizens to prosper.  Achieving this is OPR’s vision. Check it out at www.opr.org.in website.  If you are in agreement, join the OPR; together, we can do it.</p>
